Giphy Search Frontend
=====================

This is an alternate search frontend for
[Giphy](https://giphy.com/).
It aims to be lightweight but usable.

Key features:

- Quick navigation
- Ability to see giphies in their actual size while browsing

### Usage

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```

### Implementation Notes

This was my first non-trivial React project.
It was also the project I used to understand Redux.
As such some of the code can be messy.
But it does work.

I am still working on figuring out a nice UX that performs
auto-zoom of giphies on hover.
